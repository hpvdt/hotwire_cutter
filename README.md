# hotwire_cutter
The teams custom built hot-wire cutter. Built originally to run off of the [grbl Mega 4axis](https://github.com/dguerizec/grbl-Mega-4axis) project.

However we have moved to using [rcKieth](https://rckeith.co.uk/grbl-hotwire-mega-5x-for-cnc-foam-cutters/)'s project for controlling the cutter and needed to us their [custom flavour](https://github.com/fra589/grbl-Mega-5X) of grbl as a result. However since the board we use to interface was designed for the other firmware, the pin allocations had to be changed as well as some of the behavior.
