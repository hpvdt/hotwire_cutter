Around line 300 in "gcode.c" is where the commands for different axes are routed based on designator.

By default these are set to X,Y,Z and then additional axes as A,B,C. 

However since some software may refer to the fourth axis as something else (e.g. "U") you can change one of the cases for the switch to match that letter.

For example if we swap the "A" for a "U" everytime a command comes in for "U" grbl will treat it internally like it is axis "A".

Axes are enabled or disabled by adjusting the corrisponding "#define" statements in "nuts_bolts.h"
